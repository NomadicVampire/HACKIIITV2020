Safety and Vehicle Control: The service ensures safety assistance to vehicle operators through information regarding vigilance and vehicle control. Drivers can assess their driving capabilities, road conditions, and vehicle performance. They can be warned about any front or rear end collisions when they are changing lanes or turning at intersections by tracking position of other vehicles. Also advanced sensors in vehicles can assist drivers during poor visibility period due to bad weather or night vision by capturing images of surrounding environment. The goal is to reduce accident or crash situation by informing drivers as well as emergency operators of the imminent collisions.
